    .SYNOPSIS
        Create and configure test automation certificate
        
    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates a new self signed certificate for automated testing and reconfigures the AOS Windows Identity Foundation configuration to trust the certificate
        
    .PARAMETER CertificateFileName
        Filename to be used when exporting the cer file
        
    .PARAMETER PrivateKeyFileName
        Filename to be used when exporting the pfx file
        
    .PARAMETER Password
        The password that you want to use to protect your certificate with

    .PARAMETER CertificateOnly
        Switch specifying if only the certificate needs to be created.
        If specified, then only the certificate is created and the thumbprint is not added to the wif.config on the AOS side.
        If not specified (default) then the certificate is created and installed and the corresponding thumbprint is added to the wif.config on the local machine.
        
    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Initialize-D365TestAutomationCertificate

        This will generate a certificate for issuer 127.0.0.1 and install it in the trusted root certificates and modify the wif.config of the AOS to include the thumbprint and trust the certificate.
        
    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Initialize-D365TestAutomationCertificate -CertificateOnly
        
        This will generate a certificate for issuer 127.0.0.1 and install it in the trusted root certificates.
        No actions will be taken regarding modifying the AOS wif.config file.
        Use this when installing RSAT on a machine different from the AOS where RSAT is pointing to.
